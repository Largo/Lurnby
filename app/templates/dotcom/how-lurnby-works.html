        <p>Lurnby doesn't do any magic - for a software product, it might even be a little bit boring.</p>
        <p>You add things to read. You read them. You highlight as you read. You organize your highlights into groups you create. You reflect.</p>
        <p>But we guess it's the details that are important...</p>

                    With Lurnby, you can add all of your reading content to a single place - whether that's web articles, ebooks, pdfs, newsletters, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reading is easy. Choose your settings, get rid of ads, follow your progress.
                </li>
                <li>Keep only what's meaningful to you. Highlight key concepts and passages, add notes, group your highlights so you can build larger mental concepts across everything you are reading. </li>
                <li>Remember more with reviews. Lurnby supports active recall practice and spaced repetition.</li>
                <li>Write articles, essays, or posts with your highlights to deepen your comprehension. </li>
            </ol>
